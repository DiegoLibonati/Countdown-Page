# Countdown Page

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.

The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`
